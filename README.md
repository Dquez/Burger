# Burgerdize

## Overview

In this project, I created app that allows you to enter a burger you'd like to "eat". This app is a full-stack app which performs multiple functions on the back end, including routing the user based on the url endpoint they request, utilizing a custom ORM to query the sql Database, and sending the data back to the user using a custom API and ajax calls.

## How I built it

I primarily worked with node.js, handlebars, and the express frame work to handle routing, connecting to the server and sending files to the front end. On the front end, I used html, javascript, jQuery and a little bit of css. There is still room for improvement including adding more animations and some interactivity with clicking buttons. I included the following packages:
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [bodyParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table)
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override)
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

Running an npm install should install all of the dependencies you need to get this project started.
